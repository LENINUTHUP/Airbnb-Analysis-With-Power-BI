# Airbnb-Analysis-With-Power-BI
For this challenge I had the pleasure to analyze Airbnb data listings in few major cities, including information about hosts, pricing, location, and room type, along with over  million historical reviews.
# Background Information
Airbnb is an immensely popular global platform that was established in 2008. It offers individuals the opportunity to rent out their properties, including homes and apartments, to travellers who need accommodation. Hosts have the freedom to list their space, set prices and availability, and directly communicate with potential guests. Travelers, on the other hand, can search for suitable accommodations based on their preferences, location, and budget. This innovative service provides a more affordable and convenient alternative to conventional hotels, while also enabling travelers to experience local communities and neighbourhoods uniquely. With millions of listings in over 220 countries and regions, Airbnb has revolutionized the travel industry.
